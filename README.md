# Overview
-In this project, I built a simple website for an arts and crafts store. This project was given as an assignement in Codecademy.

# Purpose
- The purpose of this project was to see if I could build the website without step-by-step instructions. It was also to see if I could follow the page styling instructions that were provided in a design spec, which I learned is a standard document used in freelance web development.
- I also wanted to play around with the style a little bit to get more practice in. I made a few alterations to the original project by adding different color headings and changed the title color and added a hover effect with a different color. I also wanted to practice using the text-shadow feature I Googled so the title would stand out more against the background.

# What I learned
- I learned that the more I've practiced, the easier things are becoming. It was easy to build the website and when I didn't know something, like how to add the text-shadow, I was able to find it quickly with a search.
- It was also very interesting being able to rely on a spec design in order to complete my project and made me feel like I'm making progress.
